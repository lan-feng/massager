Login Screen
Create a modern Android login screen UI for an app named "MASSAGER".
Use Kotlin with Jetpack Compose (or Flutter if specified).
The layout should include:

- App logo at the top (a rounded red "M" icon)
- Title text: “Log In”
- Two input fields:
  1. Email (text input with placeholder “Please enter your email”)
  2. Password (password input with visibility toggle, placeholder “Please enter your password”)
- A large red “Log In” button.
- Below the button:
  - “Sign Up” (navigate to Sign Up screen)
  - “Forget your password”
- Third-party login buttons:
  - Guest (icon + label)
  - Google login
  - Facebook login
- Footer: small gray text “By continuing you agree with xyj's User Agreement and Privacy Policy”

Add smooth animations for button presses.
Use Material 3 styling, rounded corners, and shadow effects for buttons.
Handle input validation: email format and non-empty password.
