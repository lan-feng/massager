Sign Up Screen
Design a "Sign Up" screen for the MASSAGER app in Kotlin (Jetpack Compose).

UI requirements:
- App logo centered on top.
- Title: “Sign Up”.
- Three input fields:
  1. Email: placeholder “Please enter your email”.
  2. Verification code: placeholder “Please enter the verification code” + “Get code” button on the right.
  3. Password: placeholder “Please enter your password”.
- Password validation rule: must be 6–12 characters and contain both letters and numbers (no pure numbers).
- Display an inline warning if the password doesn’t meet this rule.
- Large red “Submit” button.
- Footer: “By continuing you agree with xyj’s User Agreement and Privacy Policy”.
- Smooth transitions between Login and Sign Up screens.
- Simulate the verification code countdown and disable the “Get code” button for 60 seconds after pressing.

Add basic form validation logic and navigation back to the Login screen after successful registration.
